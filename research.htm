		<h1>lab research</h1>
			<p>At a high level, our research is focused on 1&#41; conservation ecology of native 
			semi-aquatic and aquatic species in western Canada, and 2&#41; the health of their 
			habitats. Cognizant of the lands we live and work on, we strive to work in a good way 
			with local First Nations and M&eacute;tis individuals, communities, and organizations 
			&#40;e.g., <a href="https://ucalgary.ca/news/indigenous-led-climate-action-initiatives-partnership-ucalgary">UToday article</a>&#41;.
			<br /><br />
					
			Over the next five years &#40;2026-2030&#41;, together with  
			&#40;<a href="https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/benjamin-barst">Dr. Ben Barst</a>&#41; and 
			local First Nations communities in the Treaty 7 region,
			we will be examining the health of the Bow and Oldman Rivers from headwaters to prairies, 
			with an eye to performing targeted conservation translocations of bull trout in attempt to 
			restore populations at sites within their historical range. As mentioned in this 
			&#40;<a href="https://ucalgary.ca/news/investment-environmental-damages-fund-sets-stage-bull-trouts-comeback">UToday article</a>&#41;, 
			Dr. Barst will focus on water quality and trace metals and we will focus on diversity and 
			health of aquatic macroinvertebrates as indicators of site health and capacity to 
			sustain fish populations.
			<br /><br />
			
			Some recent investigations include beaver impacts on aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity 
			and mercury levels in water and dragonfly larvae &#40;Gr&eacute;goire, in progress&#41;, a multi-year examination of the status and long-term 
			viability of long-toed salamanders in the Bow and Kananaskis Valleys

			Marine-derived nitrogen levels are significantly higher at a site where Chinook salmon 
			historically spawned &#40;Positive Control&#41; than where they were absent 
			&#40;Negative Control&#41;, underscoring the ecosystem-wide consequences of their crash

			Results of population viability analyses underscoring the importance of high adult survival, 
			dispersal, and an absence of catastrophes &#40;e.g., severe drought&#41; for the 
			long-term persistence of long-toed salamanders &#40;for more, see

			Climate change and ongoing development in the region negatively impact all three factors.

		<h1>lab EDI statement</h1>
			<p>Our research is better when we include people with diverse experiences, backgrounds, 
			and ways of thinking and interacting with the natural world. Accordingly, we seek to recruit, 
			support, and mentor members from diverse backgrounds, with an active focus on folks from 
			historically marginalized groups. The sciences have not always been a welcoming space for 
			everyone, and we actively work to create an inclusive environment. We also acknowledge that 
			doing so is a lifelong journey, not a “one and done” item to be crossed off a checklist.
